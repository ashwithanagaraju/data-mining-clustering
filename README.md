# Data Mining: Clustering and Model Analysis

## Overview
This project explores clustering and feature analysis using classical data mining techniques. It includes preprocessing, exploratory analysis, K-means clustering, and evaluation using the elbow and silhouette methods.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- K-means clustering
- Elbow and silhouette evaluation
- Cluster visualization
- JSON backend for exporting processed outputs

## How to Run
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open and run:
`clustering_analysis.ipynb`

## Notes
- Only sample JSON data is included.
- Full dataset should be downloaded separately.
