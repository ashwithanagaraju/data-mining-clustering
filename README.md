# Data Mining: Clustering and Model Analysis

This project applies classical data mining techniques to explore structure and patterns within data through clustering and feature analysis. The solution focuses on unsupervised learning to group observations based on similarity, enabling exploratory insights into underlying data distributions and relationships.

The project leverages data preprocessing, feature scaling, and clustering methods to analyze data behavior and evaluate cluster quality using standard validation techniques. Results are examined through analytical visualizations and structured outputs, demonstrating how clustering can be used to support exploratory analysis and data-driven understanding in practical data mining scenarios.
